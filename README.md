# PyComputerVision
I happened to do a ton of work in the past year related to image processing. This repo appears to bundle them all. A lot of the codes here helped form the basis of my understanding in a lot of computer vision topics. 

## NOTES
Topics covered include edge detection, stereo disparity, perspective correction and even stuff on building a 3D map of Rwanda :)
