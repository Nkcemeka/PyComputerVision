# PyComputerVision
I happened a ton of work in the past year related to image processing. This repo appears to bundle them all. A lot of the codes here helped form the basis of my understanding in a lot of computer vision topics. 

## NOTES
Areas covered here include edge detection, stereo disparity, perspective correction <br>
and even stuff on building a 3D map of Rwanda.
